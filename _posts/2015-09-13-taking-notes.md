I’ve been taking notes at work and for BJJ a lot more this year, and I’ve found it helps my progress and learning a lot. I like to think of taking notes as compound interest on my learning - maybe I’m only improving my uptake by 1-2%, but over many years it adds up to a much larger overall improvement.

Taking notes consistently is also useful for maintaining habits, and can be a fairly easy habit of its own as a starting point for improvement in other areas of your life. My own dieting and training consistence were much easier to maintain once I’d made a habit of writing down what I ate and what I learned every day.

I figured I’d share my main two ways of taking notes, and how they help me get better in both arenas. Neither are perfect, but maybe you could use them as a starting point.

My first method is for stuff I’ve just learned, and I use this most heavily for my BJJ training. There are three modes:

1. “brain vomit” - first-thing-you-think of comments. This is nice to do after training or right after you’ve finished a project and it’s still fresh in your mind. Mostly, you’re just trying to get down everything you can think of before your brain decides to forget the small-but-important details.

2. basic long-form-commentary - generally, short paragraphs on a topic. These kinds of notes tend to be useful for sharing with co-workers or training partners, or if you’re trying to write about a topic. This seems to be the way most people take notes in class and the like.

3. QCD - Question, Comment, Do. This is what I use most for BJJ, and you can see it in the above image. The most important two are Question and Do, which remind you of which things you are having trouble with and give you short, clear goals that you can work on in the next class. It’s fairly simple, but I’ve found organizing things this way to be quite a powerful method for improving your training sessions.

The second method I use is simply aggressively using sticky notes. One of the most important parts of starting note-taking, like any habit, is actually starting to do it consistently. Reducing the friction of change helps with this, and sticky notes are very low friction - they’re cheap, you have access to a ton of them, and they are easy to both grab and throw away.

They’re obviously best for writing little snippets of information, but their portability is also great - stick them on your bedroom wall when you’re tracking your diet, and you instantly have an organized, dated list of your meals that’s easy to maintain.

Hope you can find these two methods useful for your own note-taking. While this might not help as much if you’re looking to take notes in class, it’s a nice way to get ahead elsewhere.
