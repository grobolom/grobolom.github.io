Kanban is pretty interesting. Fundamentally it’s not much different than keeping a decent to-do list. In practice, however, having a visible list of completed tasks that are visually separate, not just crossed out, is subtly encouraging. One of the problems with a regular to-do list is you get this ever-expanding list that never really goes anywhere - you hide your own accomplishments when they are complete.

Kanban (or at least my bastardization of it) is also helpful because you can organize you actual to-dos in more than one way. Often at work I need to go through several staging steps for a particular task - getting an initial email, doing spec and follow-ups. Often it’s not until later than I can really add a task directly to my list, but I don’t feel that it’s helpful to split the task into all these multiple parts - being able to move it through a set of stages, however, is very helpful.
