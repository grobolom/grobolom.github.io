Today was definitely one of those days. Lots of progress but nothing really tangible to show for it. I spend the majority of the day working and then spend a huge amount of time studying and finish the setup of GalliumOS on my chromebook. It was objectively an extremely fruitful day, but subjectively I didn’t feel like I’d really done much. There I was, sitting in the B&N, watching the sun set behind the trees in the distance, Kanban board unchanged except for the single backlog item now pushed into the progress box.

Still, this is not something to get discouraged by, and is one of the reasons I highly recommend keeping a daily journal. A journal that you update regularly so you can build a habit of noting all of the successes and progress you’ve had during the day. It’s also useful to remember that not every day is going to be a huge progress push. Some days are relaxation days. Some days are tougher days. Some days are simply set-up days, much like this one - you invest a little bit extra of your time and it pays big dividends later down the line.

Remember that your goals and the journey to get to them is not a singular step and doesn’t end with one wrong turn. There are plenty of days ahead and plenty of time to make the progress you want.
