Today, I experienced a somewhat odd feeling - a competition victory that was not just hollow, but actively frustrating and upsetting.

BJJ competitions can be incredibly intense. Matches bring out the fight-or-flight response often, and competitors have to make rapid decisions; they are trapped in the world of the split-second. While this brings out many positive qualities in people, it also brings out some awful ones, the worst being ego.

Ego led to my opponent’s injury today. While on the longer timeline ego maybe a net zero, today it was a net negative - minus one arm injury and a couple months of training. Ego was the only reason my opponent decided to try to escape a locked-in Kimura submission. It was certainly the reason he kept going despite the initial protest of his arm in the form of crunching, twisting noises that no one should like to hear or feel coming from any internal part of their body.

As I write this, many hours later, I still sit frustrated and upset. I apologized to my opponent of course, as well as his coach, and both assured me not to worry and that ‘these things happen’. Maybe they do. Maybe they shouldn’t.
