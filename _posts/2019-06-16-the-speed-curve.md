“Metrics” said the engineer. “We need metrics to measure our success”. And so velocity and predictability were born.

One of the challenges of Scrum and Agile methodology are that there are no easy-to-grasp, rigid metrics that we can use to immediately evaluate ourselves and our projects. By encouraging a more fluid system of project management, we open ourselves up to never really understanding whether or not we did the right thing. Was it a good thing that we cancelled something in Beta 2 because we realized our beta testers were not happy with it? Or would it have been better if we’d hit faster deadlines for it, or finished out the whole project before showing it to customers that didn’t perfectly fit our target audience.

In this post, I won’t get into the specifics of evaluating these end-goals. High-level decisions like project direction are one thing, but the minutia can be a bit easier to handle. For example, many teams use planning poker or similar methodology to estimate how much effort they are putting into their work. These estimates are used by managers and teams to determine if a team is successful or not.

I’d like to talk about one of the problems I have with these metrics. I’d like to explain why I prefer more fluid metrics, even if those metrics require more human judgement to evaluate.

Estimates being flaky is the first issue. Unless a team is very experienced with their codebase and has extremely good specifications, estimates about how much work a task takes are likely to differ wildly. Maybe editing a piece of copy or adding an image on the homepage of your platform can be consistently pointed as a ‘1′. But that task to add a column to your users table gets estimated as a ‘2′ by half of your engineers and a ‘5′ by the other half - some figure the change you’ll need to do to surface that UI element will take them a day, along with the QA steps needed to release it to production; others argue it will take only a few minutes, and that the testing can be accomplished much more quickly.
