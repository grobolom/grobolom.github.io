The more time I spend on my desktop and laptop, the more and more I understand why Macs are the dev laptop of choice.

- If you work with iOS in any way, you really need a Mac.

- For most full-stack developers, you’re connecting to some sort of UNIX environment. Having to do some funky samba stuff or messing with the buggy sshfs-win isn’t great.

- Windows has no native workspace support, which means working on a laptop is significantly more difficult.

These are my primary issues, though there are others. It’s not that working with Windows is impossible, or that there are no other options - working in an Ubuntu VM is something I do regularly. I’m just learning to appreciate the convenience of a platform that has native UNIX support, is required for iOS dev work, and has better native features and tooling for dev work than Windows.
