I’ve recently considered that one of the best ways to make a change in your life is to reduce the difficulty of making that change. I’ve tried to make many changes recently: trying to learn a new language, keeping up with progressing in my software development, sticking to reading at book every week, working out regularly, and keeping a decent diet. However, the thing that has kept me on track in these goals has always been making them into habits.

However, making a habit is not so simple. New habits are hard to stick to. Sometimes, you just don’t feel like working out. But what I’ve found helps immensely is making the habit easy to follow and hard to break. Keeping a journal, asking people to follow your progress, setting an alarm or writing yourself notes - all of these things help to reduce the friction of keeping a new habit.

It’s been most obvious to me in attempting to keep a diet how much these little things help. Just writing down what I eat has a huge cascading effect on how much I end up eating. From thinking about what I ate it just a bit longer after I eat, to forcing me to keep myself honest about how much I eat, this little change drastically reduces the difficulty of keeping my habit.
