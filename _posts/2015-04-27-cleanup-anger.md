It’s extremely infuriating to deal with a complete lack of care for code quality in the dev world. My coworkers spent a whole bunch of time working on a particular file a long time ago but didn’t spare a single second to actually refactor it. Thus, I’m left using this steaming pile of shit that I can’t even decouple from the rest of our code. Welcome to taco hell.

Worst of all, it’s costing them more time indirectly since I’m unable to do my work properly. Sigh.
