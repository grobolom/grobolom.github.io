I’ve been using tmux a bunch lately at my work and it’s been a huge productivity increase. Maybe I don’t have a particularly good workflow in general, but my job in particular tends to require a lot of different PuTTY/ssh sessions for me to work optimally. tmux has been great because it allows me to instantly reconnect to all the different servers I need to be running commands on without doing it manually all the time.

It’s also solid for having windows side-by-side that I need to work on. I’m by no means a guru yet at swapping through tmux and vim like a maniac but even just a basic “here’s my dev, here’s production, here’s my testing screen” workflow is a huge productivity boost. No alt-tabbing through tons of windows waiting to hit the right one, especially when each screen only really needs to take up 120 characters of width.
