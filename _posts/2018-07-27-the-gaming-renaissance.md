I think the boardgame renaissance is one of the most interesting and positive
developments in the gaming world in the last decade. From the mediocre world of Monopoly and Risk come fantastic games like Splendor, Mysterium, or Gloomhaven; games that expand the boundaries of what boards games are; games that push back, hard, against the assumption that gaming has to be a stale, regimented process.

Traditional games have always been a way to bring people together around a
table. I can’t count the number of people I’ve met that tell stories about the
times they played Monopoly for hours on end. Or the time their Uno session ended with their grandmother flipping over a table. These are funny anecdotes, but today’s gaming world is much more than that. Today’s board games provide narrative. They provide excitement. They force you to think, to engage, but also to re-evaluate what you think cardboard is capable of.

Take a game like Mysterium, a 2015 game designed by Oleksandr Nevskiy and Oleg Sidorenko. At face value, the game is an advanced version of clue - players are guided towards identifying a murderer, a murder location, and a murder weapon that corresponds to their character in the game. A single player plays the ‘ghost’, the guide that provides the clues for the other players. At first glance, the game doesn’t seem particularly deep; building up the clues using the tarot-esque cards provided to the ghost is fun, but that’s about all of it.

However, this game is so much more than that. The clue cards are insanely detailed, abstract pieces of art. The process of getting and giving clues relies not only on the available cards, but also the thoughts and tendencies of your fellow players. Both sides - guessers and clue givers - are forced to dive deep into what parts of which clues apply. They must imagine what the thought process of the person playing each part is, on top of the straight facts of the game.

What’s more, the game can be warped and changed in many ways that a simpler game like Clue cannot. Have too many players? Have the 'ghost’ be a whole team of players, sharing clue cards and coming up with a plan to distribute them. Warp the game even further by setting 'guessers’ on different teams, each with their own 'ghost’ - share the clue cards, fight over who gives the better clues and gets their team to the finish fastest. Change the nature of the game entirely and have the 'guessers’ give clues to the ghost, each only able to provide a bit of information at a time - guiding the guide instead.

This isn’t to say there’s no way to 'spice up’ some well-known games. There are many 'house rules’ around Monopoly, and no less than a dozen ways to mess with Risk. The difference is the scope and ease of adjusting the games of the new era. There is no need to bend over backwards adjusting property prices or messing with dice probability - the tools are all there, ready to use.

Adjustability is only one of the many ways games today push the limits - games like 7th Continent redefine what it means to build a narrative in a game, and games like Gloomhaven replace well-known pastimes like Dungeons and Dragons and replace it with a faster pace, easier rules, and a pre-built story and world. Scythe ignores the limits of more traditional strategy games like Risk and Diplomacy, and games like Coup and One Night Ultimate Werewolf and Resistance solve the problems of older games like Mafia.

There’s no better time to get into board games, and no better time to be a long-time fan. Every GenCon brings something new, something bold, something exciting. I can’t wait to see what’s next.
