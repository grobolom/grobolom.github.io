I saw this great response on SA by user sarehu to a question regarding which properties should be passed to a function as parameters vs. which could be imported behind-the-scenes:

- All the function’s inputs.

- All the function’s outputs.

- Anythingelse that could affect the function’s behavior (i.e. inputs).
