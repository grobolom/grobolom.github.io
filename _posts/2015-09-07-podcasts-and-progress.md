I’ve finally found a few good podcasts that match my programming expertise. A few months/years ago I tried to listen to stuff like Ruby Rogues and Avdi Grimm’s screencasts and it went way over my head. Now I’m learning quite a bit from them.

[Ruby Tapas](https://www.rubytapas.com/)

The next step is finding a few user groups and really getting into the programming community. It’s a process, but it’s nice to be back into writing software and really having fun with it (even at my fairly uninteresting job).
