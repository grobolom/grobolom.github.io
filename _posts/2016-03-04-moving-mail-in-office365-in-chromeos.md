One of the major ways I stay on top of mail is to aggressively archive stuff as soon as it’s complete. On a Chromebook, there is limited access to email clients, so my only good option for Microsoft Exchange is Office365. However, the shortcut for moving mail (Control-Shift-B) is already taken up by the ‘show Bookmarks bar’ shortcut. However, if you create an archive folder, you can use the ‘E’ shortcut to move mail directly there.

It doesn’t give you a whole lot of power to dictate exactly where things go if you have multiple folders you need to organize to, but this at least solves my particular use case - hopefully it will save someone else time, too!
