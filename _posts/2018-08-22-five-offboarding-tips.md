Having left my position at Hearst, I was responsible for transferring almost two years' worth of knowledge to the tech leads that would replace me in just a couple short weeks. This was a daunting task, but, while there were some hiccups, I think I was able to do so successfully. It required some forethought and a good place to store and share documentation, but at the end of the day just making sure to care about the process did the most good.

Now that I'm through the process, I'd like to give a few tips as to how you can ensure the same process at your company, be it when you yourself leave or when someone else is getting ready to. Some of these will be tips for outside the actual offboarding process, as ensuring good offboarding means setting up good practices even during less turbulent times.

## 1. Have a single docs location

Have a single docs location that everyone on the team has access to.

Having a single point where the whole team goes to for documentation is crucial in any organization, not just for the offboarding process. However, it may not be obvious how critical this is until a high-quality contributor leaves. Whatever the situation, make sure that during this time, you make sure all the documentation related to this person leaving is moved to a single source of truth, and that everyone on the team that is participating in the transition process can easily get to it.

Having this in place will guarantee that everyone stays focused on what is important - leaving behind a concise record of what is known, what is unknown, and where to go from here. Having multiple docs locations, or no clearly assigned spot, means someone may have to spend time reconstructing a web of relationships after the contributor leaves, which wastes time at best, or loses knowledge permanently at worst.

## 2. Schedule regular knowledge sharing sessions

Schedule regular knowledge sharing sessions and deep-dives.

This is another tip that can be implemented immediately, but one of the best ways you can ensure that losing someone doesn't crush your productivity or kill a team is to regularly schedule knowledge sharing sessions. One of the ways I've seen this happen is to schedule a weekly 'developer chapter' meeting, where engineers are encouraged to talk about and give presentations on work they have done recently on their teams, or even things they have learned or worked on during their spare time.

Keeping well ahead of inevitable team changes is critical. One of the biggest benefits is that doing these sessions ahead of time means that the knowledge tends to be fresh. Scheduling these sessions only at the last minute means a contributor may be trying to remember design decisions or challenging problem solutions at a time when they are being bombarded with hundreds of other questions. It also means that the time spent offboarding can be left for the really tough questions - post-mortem-style questions like 'what would you have done differently on this project' or 'what are the likely upcoming technical hurdles' rather than minutia.

## 3. Set up a Q&A section

Set up a 'Q&A' section that everyone can post to.

One of the better ways to guarantee good knowledge transfer is to ask questions, and keeping those questions public is the best way to keep the flow going. Answering questions in a 'Q&A' format is a good way to both sort through potential gaps in knowledge. It is also less intimidating for newer engineers or those less comfortable publicly asking for some of this information to contribute to the process in a meaningful way. You should periodically sort these questions into sections based on topic so that the end result isn't an unwieldy wall of text, but on the whole even a less sorted list can be helpful.

## 4. Quickly schedule knowledge shares for missing gaps

It's most important to rapidly move the person leaving from doing work to moving knowledge to other people. One of the ways you can guarantee a big loss to your company is letting an engineer that is already leaving take all the knowledge they have accumulated, all the bugs they know exist and the tricks they have mastered to get around in your system, and leave without giving any of it away. While there may be important outstanding projects that need to be finished in the timeframe of this person moving on, a focus on getting down what can never be replaced is usually more important than knocking out a few extra tickets.

This is a tip that is also most likely to change as circumstances on the ground change. If there are major feature planning sessions or really important pieces of functionality that are due immediately, it may be more important for this person to finish these tasks than to immediately start writing notes and docs. That said, it's still often the right move to eat the productivity hit and understand that some things will come in late. It also easier to account for a guaranteed miss on some deliverable than try to eke out a last few hours of work from someone whose productivity may already be on the downswing.

## 5. Assign an offboarding point person

The quickest way to get traction on any project is to assign someone to be the main shepherd of that work. Assigning a point person to be the go-to for the off-boarding process is useful for making sure nothing gets missed. It ensures that the teams remaining stay focused on their work and are minimally impacted by the transition process. It also means that the person being offboarded has a consistent line of communication to go through; any questions, issues that arise, or help this person needs to get things in order before leaving can be addressed to a single responsible party.

Keeping these lines of communications clear is important from both sides. It may be that management has many questions for the person leaving, as do other team leads. Having a dozen interrupting meetings with a variety of concerned workers will make it difficult for the person to focus on sharing their knowledge in a concise and consistent way. They may be distracted and miss important information, or say something verbally that is not written down, but missed later because it was 'already said'.

These tips are only the starting point of making your offboarding process a clean and enjoyable one. They serve to help you keep your relationship with the former employee intact, as well as make sure the company continues chugging along without losing a ton of productive time whenever someone decides to leave. With the [tech industry hitting an average attrition rate of 23%](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-strategy/industries-with-the-highest-turnover-rates), it's important to plan for this inevitability. I hope this leaves you with a good starting point, and gives you some ideas on how to better your own processes.
