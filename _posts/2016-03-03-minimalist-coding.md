I am not a minimalist in my daily life, but in the interests of experimentation I’ve decided to embrace a little bit of it in my software development. I’ve done some work in limited environments before - the majority of my school coding and the first couple years out of college were done on a 10″ EEEPC. I found the limitations didn’t impact my productivity; in some cases, my productivity seemed to improve. I suspect the lack of minor distractions that came with the inability to open a million tabs had a positive effect. So now:

We’re back to the realm of the small.

I definitely subscribe to the idea of adversity and limitations bringing out creativity. To that end, I hope this little experiment has a positive result. I guess we’ll see over the new couple weeks, as I transition my work environment as much as I can over to the Chromebook.
