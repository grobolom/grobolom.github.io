One of the biggest challenges I’ve faced since I’ve moved from being an
individual contributor to tech lead has been maintaining my opportunities to
work with other senior engineers. My team has undergone significant changes and,
as a result, I’m most often the senior member working on any particular feature.
While this has had its benefits - mentorship and shared learning through
teaching - it’s not the same as daily, 1:1 discussions with extremely
experienced engineers.

One of the main hurdles to jump in this pursuit is proximity. The floor our
teams sit on is split in a very particular way, resulting in some teams sitting
quite far away from their coworkers. While engineers still have many other
coworkers to reach out to near them, this is enough of a substitute. Getting
advice from someone who only vaguely knows what you are working on is very
different from seeking the same advice from someone who is handling that code
on a daily basis.

Slack is certainly a tool that helps in this respect. It allows you to direct
your questions to exactly the developers or team you need advice from. At the
same time, the impedance of Slack, like most chat programs, is much greater than
that of person-to-person speech. Even on teams that are very comfortable having
all manner of difficult and in-depth discussion about the technical topics they
work on, this difference is notable. Turning around and asking a teammate’s
opinion almost always results in a faster, better answer.

The downside to this ease of availability is very real, though. Having teams
constantly interrupting each other in their work reduces productivity and leads
to frustration and a different form of, most often, self-imposed isolation.
However, the trade-offs are worth it, and, with some small adjustments, the
negatives can be removed entirely. Pinging someone on Slack before asking them
a question in person is good way to guage if they are absorbed into their work
or if they have time to discuss. Having obvious indicators of whether or not
someone can be interrupted can help: headphones on; a marker; an obvious timer.

The upsides to overcoming these challenges are huge. Gaining insight from a
senior developer on something can save hours or days of work. It can pre-empt a
long back-and-forth discussion in the later Code Review step. I’ve been on both
the receiving and giving end of both of these many times in the last year. As
someone who regularly walks the floor to chat with people, more than once I’ve
stepped at a desk and suggested a refactoring or fix that has saved someone
several hours of frustration. I’ve also interrupted someone from another team
for a few seconds in the coffee room and saved days of work from just a nudge
in the right direction.

At the end of the day, proximity matters for quality development. Closeness with
the engineers that you work with most closely is the primary way you can grow
and improve. From the point of view of the company, it also provides enormous
benefits in productivity and daily satisfaction. It stimulates growth in
developers by allowing them to focus on what matters instead of being mired in
minutia. It keeps senior talent from feeling isolated and unable to make the
right decisions that keeps the business moving forward. It reduces defects by
curtailing implementation problems early in the process. It is absolutely
necessary for keeping teams happy and healthy in their work.
