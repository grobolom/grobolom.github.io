Watching and reading articles about programming, you tend to see a very similar evolution. As someone starts programming, they begin by writing average code. As they get better, they try to make their code more and more clever - smaller, faster, etc. Then, as they get older and better, they realize that clever, small code is bad - and they start their road back up to clear, but long, code.
