I’m a big fan of building a visual representation of your progress in learning, be it via a Kanban-style set of post-it-notes, a log kept in your notebook, or whatever other method happens to work for me at each moment. However, one of the problems I’ve had is keeping track of things across different media.

This is especially relevant in programming, where I often need to do some learning in addition to writing code. Yesterday, I spent half of my work day reading and watching videos about Python’s asyncio. I then made a bunch of commits to my github projects, which show me a nice visual chart of my commits.

A solution is to keep a repository detailing your learning and notes. As you watch videos or take notes, every hour or half hour you can commit what you have learned to this repository. In this way, your work gets added visually to the git contributions graph.

This is useful for several reason, but the most important for me is that it allows me to better understand (or not worry about) gaps in my commit history. If I’ve spend an entire day reading[GOOS, I don’t have to worry that three months down the line I’ll look back and see a completely empty day. It removes the need to keep track of exactly which days you were learning and which you were coding, and as an added bonus it even lets you look through your commit history to seewhatyou were learning each day.

Try it out, and if it works/doesn’t work please leave a comment!
