There is definitely a point at which you must give up trying to convince someone of something. Discourse and disagreement is useful, oftentimes teaching you something in the process of the argument even if you are in the right. However, there comes a point at which you must understand that you cannot convince someone who refuses to listen.

Echoing to my own current situation, I find myself frustrated with work. I’m finding that my concerns about the maintainability of our code and the importance of SOLID design usually fall on deaf ears. In the past I have often ‘appealed to authority’ by asking my coworkers to watch well-known tech talks or conference presentations. However, this has not been enough - often my coworkers will disagree, even with devs that have many more years of more diverse experience.

So I think it’s useful to find a point at which you must give up arguing. Optimism is great, but realism is important, too, and at a certain point you may well be wasting your time trying to convince someone who doesn’t care.
