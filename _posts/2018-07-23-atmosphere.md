I have experimented with many apps and tools for reducing distractions and enhancing my meditation, but one of the best by far is [Atmosphere by Peak Pocket Studios](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.peakpocketstudios.atmosphere).

This app is a fairly straightforward white noise generator, but the details and sound quality are what set it apart from many of its competitors. The app allows you to mix and match from around 70 different sounds, even in the free version. It allows volume adjustment by sound type, allowing you to customize your listening experience very closely. It also allows you to import your own sounds, something many competing apps don’t allow you to do.

The sound quality is fantastic, and the sounds loop beautifully. Each sound loop also seems to be asymmetric, resulting in a unique listening experience each time. It avoids the issue that many apps have of having obvious ‘cycles’, which can end up ruining the immersive listening experience.

If you haven’t tried this one out yet, I highly recommend you do. The base app is ad-supported, but at only $2.49 to remove these ads, it’s a must-grab.
