Finally having a working app feels pretty amazing. I’ve finally[finished the MVP (minimum viable product) of the SimpleFoodLogthat I’ve been planning out in my head for the past six months or so. It’s a really simple app - the user types in a food with the amount of calories at the end, and the app logs it, totals it up for the day, and keeps track of the last 7 days of entries. Really barebones.

The point of the app (which I should probably explain on the app page itself) is to make it as simple as possible to enter foods. As simple as literally just typing in the calories it has, even without a name. I find that one of the keys to keeping track of your diet is making it as simple as possible. There’s basically nothing simple than simply typing “340, Enter” as your entire breakfast entry.
