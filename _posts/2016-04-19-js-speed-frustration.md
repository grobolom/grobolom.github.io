title: "JS Speed Frustration"

Perhaps this is more of a fun rant than sheer frustration, but some days JS seems to move too damn fast. I look at tutorials from late in the year 2015 that are already obsolete by January 2016. How the heck is anyone supposed to keep up with a technology that moves faster than they can write about it?

Maybe this is a good thing, though. I’ve yet to see a technology fail because it went ‘too fast’ and if this will be the first then it will at least be an amusing ride. It’s also forcing me and others to stay extra sharp, push a little harder to stay on the bleeding edge. I know it forces me to stay focused while learning and make sure my sources are good, which are important skills to have in your toolbox.

We will see how this all pans out in the near future. If JS is overtaken by some newer language in a couple years or whether it becomes a hulking monolith entrenched forever into our browsers and minds, it will be an interesting ride.
