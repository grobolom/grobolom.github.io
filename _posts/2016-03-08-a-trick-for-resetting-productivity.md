I’m not normally one to give you this sort of “One trick that soccer moms know to stay productive …” but this trick does warrant a bit of a sensationalism. The trick:

Change your environment.

Yes, that’s it. Easier said than done, of course.

The root cause of a lot of bad productivity is the eventual formation of bad habits. These bad habits tend to stick with you if you’re physically attached to them - for example, someone who works near a refrigerator gradually developing a bad habit of eating too many snacks; then finding that even when they exercise their willpower to stop snacking, they do it anyway. However, the truly insidious aspect of bad habits like these is their ability to latch on to other aspects of your environment and follow you.

In our previous example, it’s not hard to imagine the fridge worker moving his office to his house, away from the fridge and yet he still snacking too much, taking frequent trips from his desk to the kitchen. He changed his environment, but the habit remained. Why?

Because the environment is more than just your physical proximity to certain objects in the strictest sense. Your environment is also defined by ‘mental proximity’ - how much mental effort it takes to continue or resist the habits that were formed. As a result, it’s not enough for our fridge worker friend to simply change his location. He needs to pick the right kind of location, that provides him enough physicalandmental constraints to break his habit.

If you really want to make the change, you need to eliminateeverythingin your environment that connects you to that habit. Location is just a small part of it.
