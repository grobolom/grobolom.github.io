It feels pretty great to finally have an application running in the wild.

Granted, the functionality is minimal and there are no users (aside from myself), but there’s a huge pressure lifted from my shoulders now that I’ve finally created something.

It also motivates me to do more. While I’m sure eventually the bugfix train will wear on me and features will no longer be as exciting to create, at the moment I’m incredibly stoked to work more on my app.
