It’s funny that while over the years I’ve read plenty of articles about legislation intended to kill off cursive, I’m spending time on my vacations trying to re-learn it.

It’s a silly debade, in general - obviously, forcing students to obey an extremely strict rule for something that’s fairly personal is wrong. Go into any office and grab some random notepaper from people’s desks - it’s clear no one has even close to the same style of writing. That said, having a fast, legible script is incredibly useful.

Never mind the varied articles you can search for that point to the benefits of learning a cursive script, despite being in the digital age many people still take notes by hand. And, as many college students who actually try to pay attention in class can attest, there’s a huge difference in learning between taking hand-written notes and taking them through a text editor.
