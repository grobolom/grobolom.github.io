I listen to the Giant Robots Smashing Into Other Giant Robots Podcast (wow, I didn’t realize how long that was until I had to type it) pretty regularly, and a few months ago I was listening to[this episode titled “Prolificness”. It’s a great episode, and Allison House (the guest) is an impressive guest. While I can’t recall the particulars of the conversation, the piece that stuck out to me was her focus on being prolific.

The idea is that no matter what you do (in this case programming), you should be doing it all the time. You should be finding ways to immerse yourself in the world of your goal and to really showcase to both yourself and others that you are committed to it. It’s a very important idea, and highlights that even a very small amount of effort each day combines to eventually making something big (in this case, a career).

That said, being prolific ishard. It’s tough to force yourself to learn new things when your work life can be draining. It’s simple to fall into a routine of taking the last few hours of each day to unwind and do something unproductive. It’s easy to procrastinate day after day when procrastination becomes a habit.

I think the key to beating it, like beating any bad habit, is to make it easy to do the work. Don’t start coding your own blog just so you can start writing blog posts - find the simplest blog you can use that takes the least amount of setup time. Use every trick in the book to make your daily progress as simple as possible and you’ll generally succeed.

You see this mentioned in so many productivity sites under so many different names.[This Medium article has a great example, with an in-depth system that basically shows you how to split your bigger goals into smaller ones. Smaller goals means easier goals, and easier goals means you’re more likely to stick to them. Prolific is hard, but simple is easy.
