I don’t know if I wield a robust enough vocabulary to explain this clearly, but I’ll try. I’ve always been one to set goals that are, shall we say, ‘lofty’. Not unattainable, but goals like ‘Get a 4.0′ or ‘Win a world championship in X’. Goals that have a very specific ‘success’ condition, but no clear set of steps that can be taken to achieve them.

One of the more important parts of goal setting is having actionable steps to take towards your goal. Saying ‘I want to get a 4.0′ isn’t enough. What are you going to do to get that 4.0? Study an hour every night? Study more on weekends? Attend study sessions? Catch up when you’re behind on homework?

A goal like ‘set aside 1 hour every night to study Calculus for the next two weeks’ is much better. It’s a goal with just as much of a clear ‘success’ condition, but one that more naturally decomposes into the set of steps needed to achieve it.

My goal to win Pan Ams in BJJ this year was one of those ‘lofty’ goals that didn’t really provide me with good guidance. It was difficult to know what I had to do to achieve it, other than train really hard and often. But once I reframed it as ‘train 10 times a week until Pan Ams’, things became much simpler.

I understand that perhaps this is pedantry, but I think it’s critical to actually achieving your aims. Aspiring to do difficult or challenge things is commendable, but if you don’t think about the framework surrounding that goal, you make it much more difficult to actually succeed.
