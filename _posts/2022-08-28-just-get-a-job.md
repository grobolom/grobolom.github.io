In recent years I’ve seen many tweets like this one:[https://twitter.com/alicetweet/status/1562516853473230849

Here’s a novel way to avoid that college “debt trap” - get a job while going to school.

I’ve found this kind of response frustrating, as I believe it completely ignores the reality of student loan debt and taking a job while in school. As I am a graduate of Rutgers University, I would like to provide an example of how challenging ‘getting a job’ to cover your student loan debt is. Let’s take a look at getting a job at Rutgers New Brunswick, in the hopes of paying for your student loans.

Costs and the Job

First, I’d like to point out a significant barrier - it can be very difficult to find a job as a student. While positions are often open in college areas, competition is steep - there are many students looking for jobs. Anecdotally, my experience was that there were few decently-paying positions open at nearby restaurants at Rutgers. The only easily-available position was a telemarketing/sales position, which paid fairly poorly and did not provide a full-time position. This is still something, but it was the only such job of its kind at Rutgers. Thus, I’ve chosen to use a barista position in my example, as it is a position that reasonably approximates the kind of salary a student worker could expect.

Based on the[Rutgers tuition estimates, the average in-state student needs to pay $30,172 per academic year. Note that this does not include rent / food / etc. for the summer (mid-May until September, ~3 and a half months) or the winter break (short, usually only a few weeks).

[Based on some figures, the average incoming student receives only ~$3200 of scholarship aid in their first year. Being generous (and for easier calculations) let us assume that our example student receives $5000 in scholarship aid each year, resulting in a total bill of $25,000 / year that must be covered by loans or pay.

A Barista

[According to Indeed.com, the average pay for a Barista in NJ is $10.88 / hour. Let’s be generous and round up to $12.00 / hour, which is realistically the most a student would be able to find. Now, again, anecdotally, most baristas do not work a full 40 hours / week. This is quite often the case for students, as they will often not have the necessary availability to cover the full 40 hours.[There[appearsto be[plenty[of evidencethat baristas (and other, similar workers) receive less than 40 hours a week, on top of dealing with extremely inconsistent schedules and stressful work conditions. However, let’s assume that, at the very least, each worker will receive 32 hours of work a week for their weeks of employment.

Let’s calculate:

- weeks of work during school: ~37 weeks

- total hours worked at 32/week: 1,184

- total paid over this period at $12/hour:$14,208

Uhhh … that’s not enough. At a full 40 hours and $13/hour, we’re still only at ~$19k for the year. At a full 40 hours per week, at $13 / hour, and a full50 weeks of work, we reach $26,000 / year. This would cover JUST the ~9 months of school, and does not cover any other common costs:

- costs of housing during the off season.

- costs of supplies or books, whichseems to average around $1300 / year.

- travel costs / commuting costs.

Conclusions

[There is plenty of evidencethat most students[graduate with significant student loan debt- and almost a quarter graduate with significant (avg. ~$34,000) private debt, which comes with significantly less borrower protection than federal loan debt. The 'just get a job’ response is ignorant of the realities facing students, and even agenerousapproximation of what such a job would provide in loan relief still indicates that students would leave school with large debts.

In addition, this analysis does not account for other, common situations that students will find themselves in, all of which would result in an even larger gap between their education costs and their ability to pay:

- inability to find full-time employment (thus receiving <32 hours/week)

- inability to make their ideal salary (thus receiving <$10.88/week)

- additional credits / semesters of schooling required

- economic downturns resulting in inability to find work

- economic reality of the campus area resulting in inability to find work

- study / class hour conflicts resulting in reduced employment hours

Tweets like the one at the top are, at best, ignorant of the realities facing students.
