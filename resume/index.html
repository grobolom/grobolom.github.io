        <h6 class='section-header'>About Me</h6>
        <p>I'm a software dev with a bit over six years of coding experience, primarily in the PHP/PostgreSQL stack on the backend and the usual frontend HTML/JS/CSS. I've worked with Symfony and Slim for PHP and have experimented considerably with Angular 1.x and React.</p>
        <p>I am particularly well versed in working with legacy code and updating existing systems to cover them in unit tests and modernize them in preparation for adding significant new features. I believe strongly in testable code, and practice test driven development as often as I can. I'm also a strong believer in SOLID design principles, though I find these tend to come out naturally when practicing TDD.</p>
        <p>However, the skills I am most confident in are my ability to work well with others and my focus on a lifelong pursuit of learning. I read every programming book that I think is worth my time (espcially <a href="http://www.poodr.com/">Sandi Metz's POODR</a> and the recent <a href="http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/">GOOSgbt</a>). I'm constantly listening to coding podcasts (Ruby Rogues, Developer Tea, Destroy All Software) and experimenting with the latest technologies such as React. I write down a lot of my thoughts on this learning (an some off-topic material as well) on <a href="http://grobolom.tumblr.com">my blog</a>.</p>
        <p>I'm looking for a company that has devs that are as interested in learning and getting better as I am. Software development is more than my career - I love coding, and I want to be the best that I can at it. I want to learn from others that are better than me and grow along with them. I also want to work on projects that can really help people, and I think working with wonderful people is the first step towards that goal.</p>
