        <h6 class='section-header'>About Me</h6>
        <p>I'm a software dev with a bit over six years of coding experience, primarily in the PHP/PostgreSQL stack on the backend and the usual frontend HTML/JS/CSS. I've worked with Symfony and Slim for PHP and have experimented considerably with Angular 1.x and React.</p>
        <p>I am particularly well versed in working with legacy code and updating existing systems to cover them in unit tests and modernize them in preparation for adding significant new features. I believe strongly in testable code, and practice test driven development as often as I can. I'm also a strong believer in SOLID design principles, though I find these tend to come out naturally when practicing TDD.</p>
        <p>However, the skills I am most confident in are my ability to work well with others and my focus on a lifelong pursuit of learning. In an effort to advance my knowledge, I make sure to read as much relevant programming literature as I can (especially <a href="http://www.poodr.com/">Sandi Metz's POODR</a> and the recent <a href="http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/">GOOSgbt</a>). I also listen to many current development and coding podcasts (Ruby Rogues, Developer Tea, Destroy All Software), as well as experiment with the latest web technologies such as Angular and React. I write down most of my thoughts on my learning (and some off-topic material as well) on <a href="http://grobolom.tumblr.com">my blog</a>.</p>
        <p>I'm looking for a company that has devs that are as interested in learning and getting better as I am. Software development is more than my career - I love coding, and I want to be the best that I can at it. I want to learn from others that are better than me and grow along with them. I also want to work on impactful projects, and I think working with wonderful people is the first step towards that goal.</p>

        <h6 class='section-header'>Work History & Education</h6>

        <h6 class='sub-header'>Senior Developer</br>WSI Intelligent Audit (2010-2016)</h6>
        <p>This was the bulk of my development experience. I started out working basic data entry and getting familiar with the system as early as 2008. However I was hired as a full-time dev after graduating in 2010. I was a full-stack dev, progressing from junior to senior developer as well as constant project lead. I worked closely with major customers such as Microsoft to help develop an auditing and reporting engine based primarily on PHP and Postgres.</p>

        <p>My major accomplishments were a major overhaul of the legacy reporting engine, both front- and back-end, as well as a general shift in company culture towards working with OO principles and working with SOLID, test-covered code. I also designed a wide variety of front-facing reporting services for a very diverse set of customer needs. I tackled many SQL optimization problems based around legacy database design, as well as complex algorithms involving cost distribution.</p>

        <h6 class='sub-header'>B.S. in Computer & Electrical Engineering</br>Rutgers School of Engineering (2006-2010)</h6>
        <p>I graduated Rutgers with a core of classic computer science courses. My upper level classes focused primarily on C and working with the Linux kernel, as well as a strong focus around general architecture and design. My senior class work consisted of a major project written in Java involving simple AIs and mathematical equilibriums. We also did some early work in the CodeIgniter framework for PHP, designing a multi-university college application system.</p>

        <h6 class='section-header'>Projects and Experiments</h6>
        <h6 class='sub-header'><a href='http://www.grobolom.com/invoice'>Freight Invoice Tool Design</a></h6>
        <p>An experiment in working with Bootstrap and some very simple js. The major design goals were clarity and ease of use across platforms. The existing screen was disorganized, slow, and not usable on mobile devices. The design is not perfect - tables are a big problem for mobile, and one that is not easily solved. However, the new design meets all the goals and is sufficient for the majority of our users, who primarily access our tool through a desktop or larger laptop device.</p>

        <h6 class='sub-header'><a href='http://www.grobolom.com/simple-food-log/'>Simple Food Log</a></h6>
        <p>A project currently in progress, the Simple Food Log (SFL) arose out of my frustrations with existing diet and logging apps. Many popular applications have too many features (MyFitnessPal) which make entering your meals slow; this results in more difficult dieting, as users must take much more time and mental focus to keep recording their caloric intake. Manual solutions such as Excel or Google Sheets are effective but a hassle to maintain; charts need to be updated when they run out of bounds, new workbooks have to be started or sections copied-and-pasted to continue logging.</p>
        <p>The major design goals of SFL are: speed of food entry; speed of calorie logging; easy averaging and persistent diet tracking; automatic charting of progress. The intent is to marry the simplicity of manual calorie tracking with the convencience and positive reinforcement provided by quick charting and consistent meal tracking.</p>

        <h6><em>Proprietary Reporting System 2.0</em></h6>
        <p>A large update of an existing reporting system. The existing system, based in PHP, was difficult to use and slow. I designed an updated system based off my own use of the tool and off of customer interviews. After the design document was approved I worked on creating a tested, modern SPA using jQuery and PHP.</p>

        <h6><em>Freight Invoice Upload Tool</em></h6>
        <p>A PHP frontend and backend for uploading and validating a variety of freight invoices in excel and csv formats. This project's biggest challenges involved handling rapid object hydration and designing good validation for largely unsafe user input.</p>
