        <h6 class='section-header'>About Me</h6>
        <p>I'm a software dev with a bit over six years of coding experience, primarily in the PHP/PostgreSQL stack on the backend and the usual frontend HTML/JS/CSS. I've worked with Symfony and Slim for PHP and have experimented considerably with Angular 1.x and React.</p>
        <p>I am particularly well versed in working with legacy code and updating existing systems to cover them in unit tests and modernize them in preparation for adding significant new features. I believe strongly in testable code, and practice test driven development as often as I can. I'm also a strong believer in SOLID design principles, though I find these tend to come out naturally when practicing TDD.</p>
        <p>However, the skills I am most confident in are my ability to work well with others and my focus on a lifelong pursuit of learning. I read every programming book that I think is worth my time (espcially <a href="http://www.poodr.com/">Sandi Metz's POODR</a> and the recent <a href="http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/">GOOSgbt</a>). I'm constantly listening to coding podcasts (Ruby Rogues, Developer Tea, Destroy All Software) and experimenting with the latest technologies such as React. I write down a lot of my thoughts on this learning (an some off-topic material as well) on <a href="http://grobolom.tumblr.com">my blog</a>.</p>
        <p>I'm looking for a company that has devs that are as interested in learning and getting better as I am. Software development is more than my career - I love coding, and I want to be the best that I can at it. I want to learn from others that are better than me and grow along with them. I also want to work on projects that can really help people, and I think working with wonderful people is the first step towards that goal.</p>

        <h6 class='section-header'>Senior Developer</h6>
        <h6 class='sub-header'>WSI Intelligent Audit (2010-2016)</h6>
        <p>This was the bulk of my development experience. I started out working basic data entry and getting familiar with the system as early as 2008. However I was hired as a full-time dev after graduating in 2010. I was a full-stack dev, progressing from junior to senior developer as well as constant project lead. I worked closely with major customers such as Microsoft to help develop an auditing and reporting engine based primarily on PHP and Postgres.</p>

        <p>My major accomplishments were a major overhaul of the legacy reporting engine, both front- and back-end, as well as a general shift in company culture towards working with OO principles and working with SOLID, test-covered code. I also designed a wide variety of front-facing reporting services for a very diverse set of customer needs. I tackled many SQL optimization problems based around legacy database design, as well as complex algorithms involving cost distribution.</p>

        <h6 class='section-header'>B.S. in Computer & Electrical Engineering</h6>
        <h6 class='sub-header'>Rutgers School of Engineering (2006-2010)</h6>
        <p>I graduated Rutgers with a core of classic computer science courses. My upper level classes focused primarily on C and working with the Linux kernel, as well as a strong focus around general architecture and design. My senior class work consisted of a major project written in Java involving simple AIs and mathematical equilibriums. We also did some early work in the CodeIgniter framework for PHP, designing a multi-university college application system.</p>
