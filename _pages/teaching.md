## Coaching at Island City Jiu-Jitsu

I'm a brown belt and instructor at [Island City Jiu-Jitsu](https://www.islandcityjiujitsu.com) in Alameda, California.

I've been training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu for over a decade, studying under several accomplished mentors including Zach Costa, Bruno Malfacine, and Ioannis Hronakis.

BJJ is my second passion after software engineering. The problem-solving aspects of both disciplines share a lot in common - breaking down complex problems into smaller pieces, iterating on solutions, and continuous learning.

If you're in the Bay Area and interested in training, come visit the gym.
