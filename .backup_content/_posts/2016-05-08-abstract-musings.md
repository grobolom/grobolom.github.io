Lately, I’ve been having a lot of trouble deciding what level of abstraction to choose for my projects. While I’m all in favor of going ‘MVP first all the way’, I’d like to showcase my OO skills while writing this. However, I find it’s very easy (especially at 4 AM) to get bogged down in figuring out which pieces should be unit tested and how and with which collaborators.

I’m not sure there is a good solution to this other than simply more experience writing code. It’s a struggle I hear echoed by many new devs as well, though that does give me some solace in that I am not alone with this problem.

I’ve also noticed this problem occurs much more often when I’m experimenting with new code, especially in new languages. Perhaps my discomfort with a language I don’t know well leads me to revert to only working with what is simple. However, since it leads to shitty code, I’m hoping it goes away quickly.
