For some reason or another, I’ve been feeling incredibly productive this last week. “I’ve solved my life” levels of productivity. It’s incredibly refreshing, considering how frustrated I’ve been with my work and overall life goals lately.

I’m finding it’s important to temper this progress with a dose of pragmatism, however. I know that this week I feel invincible, but next week may not be the same. I may not want to jot every single note down or use pomodoro for every work period. I may spend more time at the desktop rather than the coffee shop and get distracted more.

What is most important is maintaining the solid floor beneath this surge. While I’m sure I won’t be able to commit a dozen times a day and work on every side project (it’s going to be exceedingly difficult in the last couple of days before the Pan Am tournament), I can definitely level off to a consistent level of activity. A few notes a day, a few commits a day, and over time the burst of energy will have resulted in lasting progress.
