One of my major goals this year was to win the IBJJF Pan Ams, and I trained pretty hard to get there. After a couple of grueling steam room days, three matches that had me feeling like death, I went in to the finals feeling strong and re-energized, with my coaches and friends cheering me on.

And I promptly lost.

Normally, it feels awful to get so close to your goal and have it ripped away. Especially in a sport like BJJ, where not only do you lose, the other person often gets to almost literally rip the win out of your hands.

But sometimes defeat doesn’t feel so bad. Oddly enough, by the time I got to the sidelines, I was smiling. My coaches were still happy, and my teammates were pumped that I made the podium.

Now, a week later, I’m still trying to understand why I felt so ‘OK’ at losing so soundly. I suspect that the more unlikely you are to have gotten to where you are, the less the loss is felt. I’d won some minor tournaments but gotten trounced at all the major ones. I hadn’t imagined I could make it all the way to the finals here.

I’d also accomplished a lot on my way there. I’d dropped almost 45 pounds since my heaviest, and gotten in better shape than I’d been in the last decade. I’d trained hard and motivated myself outside of training as well. I’d made it through three tough opponents, winning first by just an advantage, then by a few points, then by submission.

I’d ridden the wave; though it broken and took me with it, it was still a wonderful experience.
