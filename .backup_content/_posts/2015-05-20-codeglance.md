If you’re using PHPStorm, definitely give the above-named plugin a look. I’ve shamelessly ripped a screenshot of it from PHPStorm’s own blog:

If you’ve ever seen any of[Sandi Metz’s talks, you’ll find she often mentioned the ‘squint test’ for doing a quick evaluation of code - if things have a lot of indentation or the colors are all mashed together, you probably have an issue. This plugin is great for letting you do it.
