One of the parts of meditation that interests me the most is building the skill
of observing your thoughts. I find this most interesting because it matches the
way many other skills are learned; the idea is not to read something,
understanding it, and be able to do it; instead, the process requires you to
put yourself in a situation over and over again until the process is automatic
rather than something you guide youself into.

This process of observing your own thoughts can be fairly harrowing. As you
begin to meditate, you will notice just how chaotic and free your own thought
process is. Controlling it will seem both impossible and painful - holding
back one’s own thoughts and actively focusing on something is very challenging.
Unless you have an external focus, this process can be very near impossible.
Some thoughts will always pop in, frustrating your meditation.

This is why this process is all about letting the thoughts come and go. It’s
very important to be gentle with your thought process - being a guide rather
than a guardsman is how you can make it through. Slowly shifting your thoughts
back when they wander off, but not forcing them to stay in a particular place,
allows you to eventually narrow the band of what thoughts come in and out.

And just like any type of learning, this one needs pool-fulls of practice. And,
unlike physical skills, there are less obvious markers of success - there’s no
‘I sunk 15 baskets in a row’ or 'I got my mile run down under 7'30"’. Like the
creative process, this one is more nebulous. But give it time, and make it
regular. Even after a few weeks, you’ll find yourself much more focused, and
your drifts will come and go more smoothly
