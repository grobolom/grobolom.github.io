My team has undergone significant changes and, as a result, I’m most often the senior member working on any particular feature. While this has had its benefits - mentorship and shared learning through teaching - it’s not the same as daily, 1:1 discussions with extremely experienced engineers.</p> <p>One of the main hurdles to jump in this pursuit is proximity. The floor our teams sit on is split in a very particular way, resulting in some teams sitting quite far away from their coworkers. While engineers still have many other coworkers to reach out to near them, this is enough of a substitute. Getting advice from someone who only vaguely knows what you are working on is very different from seeking the same advice from someone who is handling that code on a daily basis.</p> <p>Slack is certainly a tool that helps in this respect. It allows you to direct your questions to exactly the developers or team you need advice from. At the same time, the impedance of Slack, like most chat programs, is much greater than that of person-to-person speech. Even on teams that are very comfortable having all manner of difficult and in-depth discussion about the technical topics they work on, this difference is notable. Turning around and asking a teammate’s opinion almost always results in a faster, better answer.</p> <p>The downside to this ease of availability is very real, though. Having teams constantly interrupting each other in their work reduces productivity and leads to frustration and a different form of, most often, self-imposed isolation. However, the trade-offs are worth it, and, with some small adjustments, the negatives can be removed entirely. Pinging someone on Slack before asking them a question in person is good way to guage if they are absorbed into their work or if they have time to discuss. Having obvious indicators of whether or not someone can be interrupted can help: headphones on; a marker; an obvious timer.</p> <p>The upsides to overcoming these challenges are huge. Gaining insight from a senior developer on something can save hours or days of work. It can pre-empt a long back-and-forth discussion in the later Code Review step. I’ve been on both the receiving and giving end of both of these many times in the last year. As someone who regularly walks the floor to chat with people, more than once I’ve stepped at a desk and suggested a refactoring or fix that has saved someone several hours of frustration. I’ve also interrupted someone from another team for a few seconds in the coffee room and saved days of work from just a nudge in the right direction.</p> <p>At the end of the day, proximity matters for quality development. Closeness with the engineers that you work with most closely is the primary way you can grow and improve. From the point of view of the company, it also provides enormous benefits in productivity and daily satisfaction. It stimulates growth in developers by allowing them to focus on what matters instead of being mired in minutia. It keeps senior talent from feeling isolated and unable to make the right decisions that keeps the business moving forward. It reduces defects by curtailing implementation problems early in the process. It is absolutely necessary for keeping teams happy and healthy in their work.</p> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2022/just-get-a-job/">Just Get a Job!</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2020/post-617149812603846656/">Post 617149812603846656</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2019/the-speed-curve/">The speed curve</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2018/five-offboarding-tips/">Five Offboarding Tips</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2018/learning-focus/">Learning Focus</a> </li> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2026 Vasja Volin. </div> </footer> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@5.0.0/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-htrLFfZJ6v5udOG+3kNLINIKh2gvoKqwEhHYfTTMICc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/masonry.js?v=a0db7e5d5c70cc3252b3138b0c91dcaf" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.1.0/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-ZgMyDAIYDYGxbcpJcfUnYwNevG/xi9OHKaR/8GK+jWc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/zoom.js?v=85ddb88934d28b74e78031fd54cf8308"></script> <script src="/assets/js/no_defer.js?v=2781658a0a2b13ed609542042a859126"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/common.js?v=c15de51d4bb57887caa2c21988d97279"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/copy_code.js?v=c8a01c11a92744d44b093fc3bda915df" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/jupyter_new_tab.js?v=d9f17b6adc2311cbabd747f4538bb15f"></script> <script async src="https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js"></script> <script async src="https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js"></script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.2/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js" integrity="sha256-MASABpB4tYktI2Oitl4t+78w/lyA+D7b/s9GEP0JOGI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/mathjax-setup.js?v=a5bb4e6a542c546dd929b24b8b236dfd"></script> <script defer src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/progress-bar.js?v=2f30e0e6801ea8f5036fa66e1ab0a71a" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="/assets/js/vanilla-back-to-top.min.js?v=f40d453793ff4f64e238e420181a1d17"></script> <script>
