Boundaries can be drawn in many ways - deciding to extract something to a class is a form of boundary drawing, as is extracting a method from a conditional. Modules and microservices are the same - just chalk outlines around a piece of functionality that delineates which parts get to hang out together.</p> <p>Getting good at figuring out the boundaries is no small task - however, even when you have a sense of the approximate line, there are details that require significant thought. One of these areas is when to remove duplication for the sake of cleaner lines. I’ll give an example:</p> <p>Some fairly straightforward code.enterScreenis called at some point by some code, and when doing so, it decides based on some condition whether to callgoFromToporgoFromBottom. Now, there is a bit of duplication here - theaddClassmethod is called twice, with the same class. For the sake of a simple argument, let us assume that this class will always be the same.</p> <p>What should we do here? Is this code good? Well, while the answer to the latter is certainly subjective, there is a case to be made for answering the former with: “let’s remove the duplication - remove those methods and do this:”</p> <p>Now, this doesn’t break any hard ‘rules’ - we can still easily test this method, and it’s short enough that it’s clear what’s happening. In addition, it saves us some lines - if we have a ton of code, this might save us a decent chunk of bytes, even in the minified code. However, I think this method is a mistake, as it causes a broader, if less obvious problem.</p> <p>The second code snipper has fuzzier boundaries. In the first snippet, we have drawn a line around our condition -isTop, and made a very declarative statement about what comes after - either we translate something from the bottom, or we translate it from the top. These ‘lines’ are delineations not only in our code organization, but in our verbiage about what the code expressly does. We are marking, very clearly, what the line around ‘translate from the bottom’ and ‘translate from the top’ means. While we are repeating some code, we are clarifying what we consider the boundary - the space between the condition and the code.</p> <p>In our second snipper, we have made this boundary a bit fuzzier. While we still have an obvious condition - isTop, and it’s clear to us what we should do in each case, we don’t have a clear understanding of what happens if this code changes. We also don’t have a clear understanding as to what isimportantin this code. We have been told (mostly) that what is important is that we are entering the screen, and that we have a condition - however, the details are not important. In the former case, we are building a fence around each part of that condition, making it clear that we think each piece is separate and important enough to be given its own chalk outline.</p> <p>This may seem pendantic, but I think it’s a decision that, over time, leads to generally better code. While there are certainly areas where you may want tonotdraw a line around a condition, in my experience most code bases would benefit greatly from that line. All code grows and evolves, but conditionals are where it decays. Drawing thick outlines keeps that decay from spreading - it makes sure that a maintainer of the code is very clear about the intentionality behing the code, not just what’s written on the lines.</p> <p>There are downsides - if you have a large codebase, this could eventually balloon it significantly. If you’re not careful, you could end up with a lot of duplication before it’s obvious that there are components that are capable of reuse. However, I trust in Sandi Metz’s famous mantra - “prefer duplication over the wrong abstraction”. It will save your ass in the long run.</p> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2022/just-get-a-job/">Just Get a Job!</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2020/post-617149812603846656/">Post 617149812603846656</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2019/the-speed-curve/">The speed curve</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2018/five-offboarding-tips/">Five Offboarding Tips</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2018/proximity/">Proximity</a> </li> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2026 Vasja Volin. </div> </footer> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@5.0.0/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-htrLFfZJ6v5udOG+3kNLINIKh2gvoKqwEhHYfTTMICc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/masonry.js?v=a0db7e5d5c70cc3252b3138b0c91dcaf" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.1.0/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-ZgMyDAIYDYGxbcpJcfUnYwNevG/xi9OHKaR/8GK+jWc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/zoom.js?v=85ddb88934d28b74e78031fd54cf8308"></script> <script src="/assets/js/no_defer.js?v=2781658a0a2b13ed609542042a859126"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/common.js?v=c15de51d4bb57887caa2c21988d97279"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/copy_code.js?v=c8a01c11a92744d44b093fc3bda915df" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/jupyter_new_tab.js?v=d9f17b6adc2311cbabd747f4538bb15f"></script> <script async src="https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js"></script> <script async src="https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js"></script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.2/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js" integrity="sha256-MASABpB4tYktI2Oitl4t+78w/lyA+D7b/s9GEP0JOGI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/mathjax-setup.js?v=a5bb4e6a542c546dd929b24b8b236dfd"></script> <script defer src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/progress-bar.js?v=2f30e0e6801ea8f5036fa66e1ab0a71a" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="/assets/js/vanilla-back-to-top.min.js?v=f40d453793ff4f64e238e420181a1d17"></script> <script>
